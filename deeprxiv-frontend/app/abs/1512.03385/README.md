## Abstract
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8 deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set.

Abstract
Deeper neural networks are more difﬁcult to train. We
present a residual learning framework to ease the training
of networks that are substantially deeper than those used
previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learn-
ing residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, in-
stead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide com-
prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual
networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from
considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we
evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8 
deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex-
ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error
on the ImageNet testset. This result won the 1st place on the
ILSVRC 2015 classiﬁcation task. We also present analysis
on CIF...
