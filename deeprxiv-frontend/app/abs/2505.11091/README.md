## Abstract
In this article, we classify all symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in Ndof embedding dimension 2d+1. Consequently, we show that in this case the property of being symmetric is equivalent to have a unique maximal gap with respect to natural partial order in Nd. Moreover, we deduce that when d > 1, there does not exist any generalized numerical semigroup of embedding dimension 2d+ 1, which is almost symmetric but not symmetric.

ABSTRACT . In this article, we classify all symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in Ndof
embedding dimension 2d+1. Consequently, we show that in this case the property of being symmet-
ric is equivalent to have a unique maximal gap with respect to natural partial order in Nd. Moreover,
we deduce that when d > 1, there does not exist any generalized numerical semigroup of embedding
dimension 2d+ 1, which is almost symmetric but not symmetric.
INTRODUCTION
LetNbe the set of nonnegative integers. A submonoid of Nhaving finite complement in it
is called a numerical semigroup . This notion is widely studied in the scientific literature, starting
from its first appearance in [21], where the so called Frobenius problem is introduced. The research
in this topic is still active and one can refer to [19] and [1] for good expository r...
