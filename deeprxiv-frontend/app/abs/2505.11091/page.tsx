Consequently, we show that in this case the property of being symmetric is equivalent to have a unique maximal gap with respect to natural partial order in Nd.

A central argument explored is the relationship between the property of being symmetric and the structure of the set of maximal gaps, also known as Frobenius-allowable elements (FA(S)), particularly for dimensions d > 1. The authors also investigate the existence of generalized numerical semigroups in this class that possess the property of being almost symmetric but are not symmetric.\n\n**Methods or Techniques Described:**\nThe text within this specific \"Overview\" section does not detail the mathematical methods or techniques used. However, it implies a rigorous approach involving classification and proof to establish the stated equivalences and non-existence results concerning properties of generalized numerical semigroups in N^d. The full paper context suggests the use of properties related to the minimal generators, gaps (H(S)), pseudo-Frobenius elements (PF(S)), and Frobenius-allowable elements (FA(S)).\n\n**Important Findings or Results:**\nThe section highlights three key findings:\n1.  A complete classification of symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in N^d with embedding dimension 2d+1 is achieved.\n2.  For the case where d > 1, the paper demonstrates that the property of a generalized numerical semigroup being symmetric is equivalent to it having a unique maximal gap (a single Frobenius-allowable element).\n3.  For d > 1, it is proven that no generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+1 exist which are almost symmetric but not symmetric.\n\n**Implications of the Information:**\nThe findings presented in this overview have several implications. The classification provides a complete description of symmetric generalized numerical semigroups within this specific family (embedding dimension 2d+1). The established equivalence between symmetry and having a unique maximal gap for d > 1 simplifies the characterization of symmetric semigroups in this context, linking a property defined by the type (number of pseudo-Frobenius elements) to a property defined by the structure of the set of gaps under the natural partial order. Furthermore, the non-existence result for \"almost symmetric but not symmetric\" semigroups indicates that for d > 1 and embedding dimension 2d+1, the notions of symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups coincide. This significantly narrows down the possibilities when studying almost symmetric semigroups in this particular setting.", "subsections": []}, {"id": "introduction", "title": "Introduction", "content": "```plain\nAnalysis and Summary of the Introduction Section\n\n1. Key Points and Arguments Presented:\nThe introduction establishes the context by first defining numerical semigroups as submonoids of the non-negative integers N with a finite complement. It notes their significance and connections to Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. The concept is then generalized to N^d for d >= 1, leading to the definition of generalized numerical semigroups, which are submonoids of N^d with a finite complement. A key property highlighted is that these generalized semigroups are finitely generated and possess a unique finite minimal set of generators; the cardinality of this set is defined as the embedding dimension, denoted e(S).\n\nThe paper focuses on extending the notions of symmetric and almost symmetric properties, well-studied for numerical semigroups, to the generalized setting. It acknowledges previous work in this direction, citing classifications for symmetric numerical semigroups of embedding dimension 2 and almost symmetric ones of embedding dimension 3.\n\nA crucial argument is based on the embedding dimension of generalized numerical semigroups in N^d. The introduction states the known lower bound for the embedding dimension of a proper generalized numerical semigroup in N^d is 2d. It mentions that the classification of symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups with this minimum embedding dimension (e=2d) is already known.\n\nThe central goal and argument of the paper are then explicitly stated: to conduct an investigation into the case of generalized numerical semigroups in N^d with embedding dimension 2d+1, focusing on their symmetric and almost symmetric properties, a case not previously explored.\n\n2. Methods or Techniques Described:\nThe introduction outlines the paper's structure, implicitly indicating the analytical approach taken. Section 1 will revisit fundamental definitions and a known result for e=2d. Section 2 will develop preliminary results (Lemmas 2.1, 2.2, 2.3), which are shown in the text snippet to involve detailed analysis of the structure of semigroups with e=2d+1 generators and their sets of Frobenius-allowable elements (FA(S)). These preliminary results analyze different structural types of generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+1. Section 3 will synthesize these results to prove the main theorem, likely using criteria related to sets of pseudo-Frobenius (PF(S)) and Frobenius-allowable (FA(S)) elements, as suggested by the definitions of symmetric and almost symmetric provided, and potentially using the criterion from Theorem 1.3 relating symmetry to the cardinality of the set of gaps H(S). The latter part of the introduction mentions computational experiments using GAP and the numericalsgps package for exploring the related case of embedding dimension 2d+2 and informing a conjecture, but the primary method for the e=2d+1 classification appears to be analytical proof based on structural analysis of generators and gap sets.\n\n3. Important Findings or Results:\nThe introduction mentions several important results from previous work:\n- Every generalized numerical semigroup is finitely generated with a unique minimal set of generators ([7]).\n- The embedding dimension e(S) >= 2d for a proper generalized numerical semigroup in N^d ([13]).\n- Classification of symmetric/almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups with e=2d is known ([4]).\n- Classification of symmetric numerical semigroups of e=2 and almost symmetric ones of e=3 is known ([19], [15], [18]).\n\nThe main findings of *this* paper, as presented in the introduction and confirmed by the subsequent text, are:\n- Classification of all symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in N^d of embedding dimension 2d+1.\n- For generalized numerical semigroups in N^d of embedding dimension 2d+1, the property of being symmetric is equivalent to having a unique maximal gap (|FA(S)| = 1).\n- When d > 1, for embedding dimension 2d+1, the properties of being symmetric and almost symmetric coincide; specifically, there are no almost symmetric but not symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in this case.\n\n4. Implications of the Information in this Section:\nThis section positions the paper as a significant contribution to the study of generalized numerical semigroups, extending fundamental classifications from the one-dimensional case (numerical semigroups) to higher dimensions. The specific focus on embedding dimension 2d+1, which is the next lowest possible embedding dimension after the minimal 2d, addresses a natural gap in the existing literature. The equivalence between symmetry and having a unique maximal gap (|FA(S)|=1) for e=2d+1 provides a powerful characterization in this case. Furthermore, the finding that symmetric and almost symmetric properties coincide for e=2d+1 when d>1 simplifies the study at this dimension and highlights a difference compared to higher embedding dimensions (like e=2d+2 where non-symmetric almost symmetric examples exist). The explicit statement of the main goal and the known results provides a clear roadmap for the reader and justifies the research effort dedicated to the e=2d+1 case. The mention of a conjecture for e=2d+2 suggests avenues for future research, implying that the structure and properties of these semigroups become more complex as embedding dimension increases.\n```", "subsections": []}, {"id": "section-1-some-notions-on-generalized-numerical-semigroups", "title": "1.

Furthermore, these specific configurations only arise when d=2.\n\n4.  **Implications of the Information:**\n    *   These lemmas provide a complete characterization of which semigroups (among the three possible structural types for e(S)=2d+1, d>1) satisfy the condition |FA(S)|=1.\n    *   As stated in the introduction and proved in the subsequent Theorem 3.1, the property of being symmetric for these semigroups is equivalent to having |FA(S)|=1. Therefore, Section 2 effectively identifies all symmetric generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+1 for d>1 by pinpointing the exact conditions on their generators and dimension under which |FA(S)|=1.\n    *   The results imply that symmetric generalized numerical semigroups of embedding dimension 2d+1 (for d>1) are limited to specific sub-types of the Case 1 and Case 3 structures when d=2, and no others.\n    *   This preparatory work significantly simplifies the proof of the main classification theorem by reducing it to verifying the symmetric property for the specific structural types and parameters identified in the lemmas as having |FA(S)|=1.", "subsections": [{"id": "lemma-2-1", "title": "Lemma 2.1", "content": "Lemma 2.1 Analysis:\n\nThis section, titled \"Lemma 2.1\", is a foundational result contributing to the paper's main goal: classifying symmetric generalized numerical semigroups (GNS) in Nd with embedding dimension 2d+1. Specifically, it focuses on one of the possible structures for such a semigroup S, as identified in the preparatory results section (Case 1 before the lemma).\n\n1.  Key Points and Arguments Presented:\n    The lemma analyzes generalized numerical semigroups S in Nd (for d > 1) generated by a set of the form {e\u2081, ..., e\u1d62\u208b\u2081, a\u2081e\u1d62, a\u2082e\u1d62, a\u2083e\u1d62, e\u1d62\u208a\u2081, ..., e<basewd>d} \u222a {e\u1d62 + d\u2c7ce\u2c7c | j \u2260 i}.

The core argument is to determine the cardinality of the set of Frobenius-allowable elements, |FA(S)|, based on the dimension d and the properties of the generating set. The proof proceeds by constructing specific elements suspected to be maximal gaps (elements in FA(S)) and proving their maximality by showing that adding any non-zero element from Nd results in an element within S. It then checks for comparability among these constructed maximal gaps to establish whether |FA(S)| is at least 2 or, under specific conditions, exactly 1.\n\n2.  Methods or Techniques Described:\n    The primary method employed is the explicit construction and analysis of elements within the set of gaps H(S), particularly candidate maximal gaps. The proof uses properties of the numerical semigroup T = \u27e8a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083\u27e9, such as its Frobenius number F(T), and the structure of elements in H(T). To prove an element f is in FA(S), the technique is to show that f is in H(S) (i.e., f is not a sum of generators) and that for any non-zero y in Nd, f+y is in S. The proof also leverages the partial order \u2264Nd to check for comparability between potential elements of FA(S). If two elements are found to be non-comparable, it implies |FA(S)| \u2265 2.\n\n3.

Implications of the Information in this Section:\n    Lemma 2.1 is a crucial step in the paper's classification effort for GNS of embedding dimension 2d+1. It addresses one of three possible structural forms for such semigroups. By establishing conditions under which |FA(S)| = 1 (a property closely related to being symmetric or almost symmetric, as discussed elsewhere in the paper, notably Theorem 3.1), the lemma significantly narrows down the possibilities for this specific semigroup structure to be symmetric when d > 1. Specifically, it shows that for this type of GNS, uniqueness of the Frobenius-allowable element is quite rare, confined mainly to the d=2 case under stringent conditions on the generators of the numerical semigroup T. This result, combined with similar analyses for other structural types (Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3), allows the authors to prove Theorem 3.1, which links symmetry to having a unique Frobenius-allowable element for GNS with embedding dimension 2d+1 when d > 1."}, {"id": "lemma-2-2", "title": "Lemma 2.2", "content": "== Lemma 2.2 Analysis ==\n\nThis section, titled \"Lemma 2.2\", examines a specific type of generalized numerical semigroup in N<sup>2</sup>.

Key Points and Arguments Presented:**\n\n*   **Semigroup Structure:** The lemma focuses on semigroups S in N<sup>2</sup> generated by the set {(a<sub>1</sub>,0), (a<sub>2</sub>,0), (0, b<sub>1</sub>), (0, b<sub>2</sub>), (1,1)}, where a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> are non-negative integers such that gcd(a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)=1 and gcd(b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>)=1. This structure implies that the projection onto the first coordinate generates a numerical semigroup T<sub>1</sub> = \u27e8a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>\u27e9 and the projection onto the second coordinate generates a numerical semigroup T<sub>2</sub> = \u27e8b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>\u27e9.

This is done by demonstrating that f+y can be expressed as a valid combination of the generators. This step frequently utilizes the property of one-dimensional numerical semigroups that if x is a gap and y > 0, then x+y belongs to the semigroup (specifically, properties related to F(T)+y \u2208 T for y>0, and F(T)-a \u2208 T if a \u2208 T).\n*   **Proof of Non-Comparability:** The proof concludes by showing that the constructed maximal gaps (specifically, f<sub>1</sub> or f'<sub>1</sub>, and f<sub>2</sub> or f'<sub>2</sub>) are not comparable under the natural partial order \u2264<sub>N<sup>2</sup></sub>, meaning neither element is greater than or equal to the other in both coordinates.\n\n**3.

It simplifies the identification of such semigroups by showing that checking the symmetry property is equivalent to checking if the semigroup has a unique Frobenius-allowable element, a potentially more tractable condition depending on the semigroup's structure. Crucially, it establishes that for this class of semigroups (d>1, embedding dimension 2d+1), the concepts of symmetric and almost symmetric are equivalent. This is a significant result because almost symmetric is a generalization of symmetric, and in many other contexts (like numerical semigroups or other embedding dimensions), almost symmetric semigroups exist that are not symmetric (i.e., have type greater than 1). The result for embedding dimension 2d+1 (when d>1) aligns with the findings for the minimal embedding dimension 2d (Proposition 1.4), suggesting a specific behavior for these lower embedding dimensions that contrasts with higher ones (e.g., 2d+2, as highlighted in the subsequent Remark 3.2)."}, {"id": "remark-3-2", "title": "Remark 3.2", "content": "## Analysis and Summary of Remark 3.2\n\nThis section, titled \"Remark 3.2\", serves to highlight a significant consequence derived from the preceding results, specifically Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 1.4, and contrast it with the behavior observed at a different embedding dimension, as illustrated by Example 3.3.\n\n1.  **Key Points and Arguments Presented:**\n    The central assertion is that for generalized numerical semigroups in Nd with d>1, the properties of being \"almost symmetric\" and \"symmetric\" are equivalent if the embedding dimension is 2d or 2d+1. This equivalence breaks down when the embedding dimension is 2d+2, where an almost symmetric semigroup is not necessarily symmetric. The remark directly states this contrast and references the results supporting each case.\n\n2.  **Methods or Techniques Described:**\n    The remark itself does not describe specific methods or techniques. It presents a consequence based on previously established results (Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 1.4) and a counterexample (Example 3.3). The results referenced were obtained through theoretical proofs and analysis of the structure and properties of generalized numerical semigroups, as detailed in earlier sections and referenced papers.\n\n3.  **Important Findings or Results:**\n    The key finding is a classification result regarding the relationship between symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups for d>1, categorized by their embedding dimension:\n    *   For embedding dimension 2d or 2d+1, the sets of symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups coincide (given d>1).\n    *   For embedding dimension 2d+2, this equivalence does not hold; there exist almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups that are not symmetric.\n\n4.  **Implications of the Information in this Section:**\n    The information in this remark establishes a critical distinction in the behavior of generalized numerical semigroups based on their embedding dimension (relative to the dimension *d* of the ambient space Nd). It indicates that embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1 share a specific property (equivalence of symmetric and almost symmetric for d>1) that is lost at embedding dimension 2d+2. This highlights the importance of embedding dimension as an invariant influencing the structure and properties of these semigroups and provides a specific point of divergence in their classification.

The primary function of this example is to demonstrate the existence of a generalized numerical semigroup that is almost symmetric but not symmetric, contrasting with findings for embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1 discussed elsewhere in the paper.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n1. Key points and arguments presented:\nThe central point is the construction and description of a generalized numerical semigroup S in N^2 with embedding dimension 6. The example explicitly lists the set of gaps H(S) and the set of pseudo-Frobenius elements PF(S) for this semigroup S. By presenting these sets, the example provides the necessary data to verify its claimed properties. The key argument relies on the definitions of symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups based on their type (|PF(S)|) and set of Frobenius-allowable elements (FA(S)). The example shows S has |PF(S)|=2, which, by definition, means S is not symmetric (as symmetric requires |PF(S)|=1) but is almost symmetric (as stated in the surrounding text, specifically Remark 3.2 and the sentence immediately following the example, which classifies it as such).\n\n2. Methods or techniques described:\nThe section defines the semigroup S by listing its minimal generators (implicitly, though the explicit list of generators (0,3),(0,4),(0,5),(1,0),(4,1),(7,2) is provided). It then presents the computed sets of gaps H(S) and pseudo-Frobenius elements PF(S). While the method used to compute these sets for this specific semigroup is not detailed within the example text itself, the surrounding text mentions computational exploration using tools like GAP and the `numericalsgps` package, suggesting computational methods were employed to find and analyze such examples. Within the example itself, the technique is to define the semigroup and state its relevant properties (H(S), PF(S)) which are then used to deduce its symmetric/almost symmetric nature.\n\n3. Important findings or results:\nThe most important finding presented in this section is the concrete existence of a generalized numerical semigroup S in N^2 with embedding dimension 6 that is almost symmetric but not symmetric. Specifically, the example shows S has |PF(S)|=2, demonstrating that the type is not necessarily 1 for an almost symmetric semigroup when the embedding dimension is 2d+2. This contrasts with the findings for embedding dimension 2d+1 (for d>1) where almost symmetric was shown to be equivalent to symmetric (|PF(S)|=1).\n\n4. Implications of the information in this section:\nThe information in this section has significant implications for the classification of symmetric and almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups based on their embedding dimension. It demonstrates that the equivalence between symmetric and almost symmetric properties, which holds for d>1 at embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1, does *not* extend to the embedding dimension 2d+2 case. This counter-example highlights that the behavior of these properties changes as the embedding dimension increases relative to d. It necessitates further investigation into the properties of almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+2 and higher, particularly regarding their type. This example directly motivates the subsequent discussion about the type of almost symmetric semigroups and the conjecture (Conjecture 3.5) regarding a potential upper bound on the type for the 2d+2 case."}, {"id": "discussion-on-type-boundedness", "title": "Discussion on Type Boundedness", "content": "Discussion on Type Boundedness\n\nThis section addresses the question of whether the type (t(S)), defined as the cardinality of the set of pseudo-Frobenius elements (PF(S)), of an almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroup (GNS) S in N^d is bounded by its embedding dimension e(S).\n\n1. Key points and arguments presented:\n* The question of type boundedness by embedding dimension is posed specifically for *almost symmetric* generalized numerical semigroups.\n* It is noted that type is *not* bounded by embedding dimension for generalized numerical semigroups in general.\n* Previous results from this paper (Theorem 3.1) and related work (Proposition 1.4, Remark 3.2) establish that for d>1, symmetric and almost symmetric GNS coincide for embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1.

Key Points and Arguments:**\nThe section builds upon previous results regarding the type of almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups for specific embedding dimensions. It notes that for embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1, almost symmetric semigroups are always symmetric when d>1 (Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.2), implying their type is 1. However, for embedding dimension 2d+2, Example 3.3 demonstrates the existence of an almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroup that is *not* symmetric (it has type 2). This raises the question of whether the type of almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups is bounded for a fixed embedding dimension, particularly for e = 2d+2. The authors argue that while the type is known to be unbounded for general semigroups of fixed embedding dimension, this question is open for the almost symmetric case. They present computational results for dimensions 2 (embedding dimension 6) and 3 (embedding dimension 8) and limited genus values (number of gaps) to support their hypothesis. These computational results consistently show the type being at most 2 for the explored cases. Based on this, they formulate Conjecture 3.5.\n\n**2. Methods or Techniques:**\nThe primary method described is computational exploration. The authors used the GAP system [11] along with the numericalsgps package [9].\n*   They explored almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in N^2 with genus (number of gaps) up to 14 and embedding dimension 6 (2d+2 for d=2).\n*   They explored almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups in N^3 with genus up to 10 and embedding dimension 8 (2d+2 for d=3).\n*   A specific procedure described in [5] was used to first compute semigroups up to permutation of coordinates for a fixed genus, and then account for all permutations to obtain the full sets, allowing for more efficient exploration of larger genus values.\n*   The types of the identified almost symmetric semigroups were calculated and analyzed.\n\n**3. Important Findings or Results:**\n*   Example 3.3 provides a concrete instance of an almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroup in N^2 (d=2, e=6) that is not symmetric (type is 2). This contrasts with the d>1 cases for embedding dimensions 2d and 2d+1.\n*   The computational results summarized in Table 1 indicate that, for the explored generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+2 (specifically, 6 in N^2 and 8 in N^3) and within the given limits on the number of gaps, all almost symmetric semigroups found were either symmetric (type 1) or pseudo-symmetric (type 2). No almost symmetric semigroups with type greater than 2 were found in these experiments.\n\n**4. Implications:**\n*   The section highlights that the relationship between symmetric and almost symmetric properties, as well as the behavior of the type invariant, changes as the embedding dimension increases relative to the spatial dimension d.\n*   The existence of almost symmetric non-symmetric semigroups at embedding dimension 2d+2 suggests this is a boundary case where new phenomena appear compared to 2d and 2d+1.\n*   Conjecture 3.5 proposes a specific upper bound (three) for the type of almost symmetric generalized numerical semigroups with embedding dimension 2d+2. This provides a concrete question for future research in the area of generalized numerical semigroups, aiming to prove or disprove this bound.\n*   The computational data, while limited, provides empirical evidence supporting the conjecture and suggests that the actual bound might even be 2, although the conjecture conservatively proposes 3.\n*   The work contributes to the broader goal of understanding invariants like the type for subclasses of generalized numerical semigroups, especially the almost symmetric ones, where the type's behavior for general embedding dimensions is complex."}]}, {"id": "acknowledgment", "title": "Acknowledgment", "content": "```\n== Acknowledgment Section Analysis ==\n\nThis section serves the standard purpose in academic publishing of formally acknowledging contributions and support received during the research process.\n\n=== 1.
