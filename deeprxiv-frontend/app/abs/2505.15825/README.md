## Abstract
Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in computer vision, with one of the most difficult tasks being Person Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify target individuals who have already been recognized and appeared in a camera network, using a robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research on PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and representation, along with powerful learning methods that enable reliable discrimination of pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO)—are modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced to combine the two types of features into a single tensor, even though their dimensions are not identical. To improve our system’s accuracy, we use Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality resulting from high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through experiments on three widely used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs very well compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.
