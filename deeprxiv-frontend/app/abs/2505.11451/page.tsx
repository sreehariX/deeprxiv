  title: 'Extracting Explainable Dates From Medical Images By Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps',
  authors: 'Lee Harris, James Bentham, Philippe De Wilde',
  abstract: 'Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is rarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used to transcribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the output produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular expressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an explainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the component parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First, we test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were unable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created easily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to detect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that looked like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically identify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that we created.',

Key Points and Arguments Presented\n\n- The research addresses the challenge of extracting precise date information from medical documents, which is crucial for impactful medical decisions but is difficult due to the complexity and variability of date formats in scanned or handwritten records.\n- Existing AI methods, including optical character recognition (OCR), handwritten character recognition (HCR), and large language models (LLMs), struggle to reliably extract precise, explainable date data, especially complex date ranges or formats.\n- Current common approaches of using regular expressions (regexes) are either too simplistic or too brittle, often failing to capture the majority of real dates or generating many false positives.\n- The paper proposes an innovative methodology that uses reverse-engineering of UNIX timestamps combined with regular expression synthesis to automatically generate regexes that can more accurately and explainably identify dates and date ranges in transcribed medical text.\n- The authors claim novelty in their approach of learning deterministic logic by reverse-engineering many-to-one mappings (UNIX timestamps to date strings) and feeding these into a regex synthesiser to produce robust, explainable date extraction rules.\n\n### 2. Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- The study begins with transcription of medical documents using OCR and HCR tools to convert images into text.\n- The authors initially test publicly-available regex patterns and find them insufficient.\n- They then manually design decomposable regexes tailored to detect complex date and date range patterns, including handling days, months in multiple formats, and ordinal suffixes.\n- To overcome the limitations and maintenance burden of manual regex creation, the authors generate synthetic datasets representing all possible dates within a given time range by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps.\n- They apply a regular expression synthesis algorithm (Regex+), which constructs regexes by minimizing a cost function balancing specificity and simplicity, using the synthetically generated examples as positive training data.\n- This synthesis produces regexes that are more precise and generalizable across different date formats and programming language contexts.\n\n### 3.

Implications of the Information in This Section\n\n- The findings demonstrate that conventional AI and heuristic methods for extracting dates from medical images are insufficient for high-stakes medical decision-making where explainability and accuracy are critical.\n- By leveraging reverse-engineering of UNIX timestamps and automated regex synthesis, the approach allows for the creation of reliable, explainable, and maintainable date extraction tools tailored to medical document transcription outputs.\n- This methodology could significantly reduce human labor costs and errors associated with manual date annotation in medical records.\n- The explainability aspect aligns with regulatory demands for human-auditable AI decisions in healthcare.\n- The approach opens avenues for applying rule synthesis and explainable logic extraction to other complex text parsing tasks in medical informatics and beyond.\n\nIn summary, the \"Title Page\" section introduces a study that innovatively combines reverse-engineering, synthetic data generation, and regular expression synthesis to create robust, explainable methods for extracting precise dates from medical images\u2014addressing key limitations of current AI and regex approaches in this critical application domain[1][2].", "citations": ["https://chatpaper.com/chatpaper/paper/137177", "https://chatpaper.com/chatpaper/?id=2&date=1747584000&page=1", "https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstreams/a9671f2d-7e09-434e-b5dc-017abc0a2544/download", "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110406344-013/pdf?licenseType=restricted", "https://www.apriorit.com/dev-blog/780-reverse-reverse-engineer-a-proprietary-file-format"], "subsections": []}, {"id": "abstract", "title": "Abstract", "content": "The Abstract of the paper titled *\"Extracting Explainable Dates From Medical Images By Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps\"* presents a clear overview of the study\u2019s objectives, methods, results, and implications.

Key Points and Arguments Presented\n- The paper addresses the challenge of extracting date information from medical images, a critical task given the importance of dates in medical decision-making.\n- It critiques existing methods, such as complex AI models and traditional regular expression approaches, for either lacking explainability or insufficient accuracy.\n- The authors argue for a novel, explainable method that leverages reverse-engineering of UNIX timestamps combined with regular expression synthesis.\n- The method aims not only to detect dates but also to generate decomposable, explainable regular expressions that map closely to the components of dates.\n- The approach is positioned as a step forward in transparent data extraction in medical contexts, where explainability and trust are paramount.\n\n### 2. Methods or Techniques Described\n- **Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps:** The method begins by generating text sequences representing all potential date formats for timestamps between specific time boundaries, allowing a comprehensive set of date strings.\n- **Regular Expression Synthesis:** Using these generated sequences as positive examples, the paper employs a regular expression synthesizer (specifically an implementation of Regex+) to automatically generate regexes that match these dates.\n- The synthesized regexes are explainable and decomposable, meaning they can be broken down into understandable components that correspond to date parts such as day, month, and year.\n- The evaluation also involves testing publicly available regexes and manually constructed bespoke regexes as baselines, to benchmark performance.\n\n### 3. Important Findings or Results\n- Synthesized regular expressions detect fewer false positives (i.e., fewer incorrect detections of non-date sequences as dates) compared to manually created regexes.\n- However, these synthesized regexes miss slightly more true dates than bespoke ones.\n- Publicly available regexes were found to be inadequate in capturing a significant number of dates in the evaluated medical documents.\n- The study demonstrates that the synthesized regexes strike a balance between high precision (reducing false positives) and acceptable recall (missing some true positives).\n- The approach surpasses prior art by allowing reliable extraction of complex dates and date ranges from text transcriptions of medical images.\n\n### 4. Implications of the Information\n- This work contributes a novel methodology for date extraction that is both explainable and robust, addressing critical concerns about transparency in medical data processing.\n- By generating regexes through synthesis from reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps, the approach guarantees completeness within a predefined date range, removing reliance on heuristic or manually engineered patterns.\n- The work supports regulatory and ethical requirements for explainability in AI applications involving sensitive data, such as medical records.\n- This method enhances automated data extraction workflows in healthcare, potentially reducing costly and error-prone manual transcription.\n- Overall, the paper positions this regex synthesis technique as a new paradigm in learning deterministic, transparent logic for date extraction, with potential applicability beyond medical texts.\n\n---\n\nThis analysis highlights the abstract\u2019s emphasis on explainability, methodological innovation, and practical outcomes in the critical domain of medical data extraction.

The analysis is as follows:\n\n### 1. Key Points and Arguments Presented\n\n- Manual transcription of medical records into digital forms remains common but is costly, error-prone, and labor-intensive. Automating this process would be beneficial, especially for extracting key data such as dates that are critical for medical decisions.\n- Existing AI methods, including computer vision and large language models (LLMs), face significant challenges in accurately and precisely extracting dates, especially complex date formats and date ranges.\n- Explainability is emphasized as a crucial requirement in this domain because medical data is high-stakes, and many regulatory frameworks require human oversight due to lack of transparency in typical AI models.\n- Current strategies for date extraction often rely on regular expressions (regex), which provide an explainable, rule-based approach. However, standard regex approaches have limitations in coverage, handling of complex date patterns, and adaptability across programming languages.\n- The authors advocate for a novel approach that synthesizes regex rules automatically by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps, thereby producing deterministic, decomposable, and robust regex patterns capable of handling a wide variety of date formats and date ranges.\n\n### 2. Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- The paper begins by testing existing regexes sourced from prior work and publicly available repositories, finding them insufficient for the target data.\n- Manual construction of bespoke regexes improves recall by detecting many real dates but at the cost of many false positives.\n- The core methodological innovation is to generate synthetic datasets of date strings by enumerating all relevant UNIX timestamps within a specified time range and their equivalent date representations.\n- These synthetic examples are fed into a regex synthesis algorithm (their implementation of the Regex+ algorithm), which automatically produces generalized but precise regexes optimized using Minimum Description Length (MDL) principles balancing simplicity and specificity.\n- Rule sets produced by this regex synthesis are deterministic and decomposable, enhancing explainability, robustness, and cross-language usability.\n- The approach uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) tools to transcribe medical document images before applying the regexes.\n\n### 3. Important Findings or Results\n\n- Publicly available regexes failed to detect a significant portion of dates in real medical documents.\n- Manually created regexes detected a higher percentage of real dates with high recall (~87.5%) but produced many false positives, lowering precision.\n- Regexes created via the regex synthesis method from reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps achieved improved precision (~82.96%) with a better balance of recall (~42.86%), outperforming the accessible regexes and showing more robustness.\n- Large language models (e.g., v3 LLaMA-8b) and computer vision approaches were unable to reliably produce precise UNIX timestamps or parse the diverse date formats, confirming that these AI methods alone are insufficient for this task.\n\n### 4. Implications of the Information in This Section\n\n- This work highlights the practical limitations of current AI and deep learning approaches for extracting precise, explainable date information from complex medical documents.\n- The proposed regex synthesis method, grounded in deterministic logic and explainability, offers a promising direction to overcome these limitations and automate date extraction with auditability and compliance potential.\n- By leveraging complete date-to-timestamp mappings, the approach avoids the pitfalls of incomplete training data and generalizes reliably over entire date domains.\n- The method supports the creation of explainable, decomposable, and language-agnostic regex rules that can be more easily maintained and trusted in high-stakes medical contexts.\n- This suggests a paradigm where AI is augmented with rule-based systems derived through synthesis, favoring transparency and precision for sensitive applications such as medical record processing.\n\nOverall, the Introduction sets the stage for a novel synthesis-based regex approach that addresses the shortcomings of manual, traditional regex, and current AI models for explainable, robust date extraction in the medical domain.", "citations": ["https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/extract-medical-named-entities-with-regex-in-healthcare-nlp-at-scale/", "https://www.docufi.com/news/dataminingintro", "https://bolinwu.blog/post/text-mining-in-python-p1-basics-of-regex/", "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/regexextract-function-4b96c140-9205-4b6e-9fbe-6aa9e783ff57", "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10401"], "subsections": [{"id": "motivation", "title": "Motivation and Problem Statement", "content": "The \"Motivation and Problem Statement\" section of the paper outlines the fundamental challenges and rationale driving the research on explainable, robust date extraction from medical documents.

The analysis of this section can be structured as follows:\n\n## Key Points and Arguments\n\n- **Date Representation via UNIX Timestamps**: The section explains that dates are frequently represented as UNIX timestamps, which count the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 (the epoch). It notes the limitation of 32-bit integers restricting timestamps to a range within 1970 to 2038, and the common use of 64-bit or floating-point representations for longer ranges[arXiv text].\n\n- **Digital Transcription through OCR and HCR**: The section distinguishes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR), highlighting that OCR is generally considered a solved problem with stable visual characteristics, whereas HCR remains more complex due to variability in handwriting features[1][2]. It outlines standard OCR processing steps including pre-processing (e.g., binarization), feature extraction, and character recognition[2][5].\n\n- **Explainability in AI**: Explainability is defined as making AI decisions understandable to humans, a crucial requirement in high-stakes fields like medical data processing. The section references definitions such as DARPA's, emphasizing the importance of models that can elucidate their rationale, strengths, and weaknesses. It also discusses the trade-off between explainability and predictive accuracy, noting that inherently explainable models often have lower accuracy than deep learning models[arXiv text].\n\n- **Use of Regular Expressions (Regex) for Data Extraction**: Regular expressions are promoted as deterministic, explainable logic for pattern matching in text. The section details their nature, how they can be visualized as deterministic finite automata, and their suitability for identifying date-like text sequences, despite some limitations such as programming language dependence and challenges in handling complex date ranges[arXiv text].\n\n- **Regular Expression Synthesis**: The paper introduces regex synthesis as an automatic method for generating compact and generalizable regexes from positive examples without requiring negative samples. It compares this approach with other algorithmic methods like genetic programming and neural synthesisers, noting the advantages of deterministic cost functions in their Regex+ implementation[arXiv text].\n\n- **Performance Metrics \u2014 Precision and Recall**: The section defines precision and recall as key metrics for evaluating date extraction, clarifying precision reflects how many predicted dates are correct, and recall measures how many real dates are detected[arXiv text].\n\n## Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- **UNIX Timestamp Conversion**: Calculation and use of UNIX timestamps as a canonical format for dates with clear boundaries and timezone considerations.\n\n- **OCR/HCR Technology**: Use of open-source or proprietary OCR and HCR tools with image pre-processing (grayscale conversion, binarization) to transcribe medical documents into text[1][2][arXiv text].\n\n- **Manual and Automated Regular Expression Construction**: Manual crafting of regexes for date and date range recognition from text, including handling various date formats, month name variations, ordinal indicators, and range delimiters; followed by automated regex synthesis from synthetically generated date text sequences reverse-engineered from UNIX timestamps[arXiv text].\n\n- **Regex+ Algorithm for Regex Synthesis**: A deterministic method leveraging Minimum Description Length (MDL) principles to balance regex complexity and specificity, producing regexes that capture all date sequences between two points in time[arXiv text].\n\n## Important Findings or Results\n\n- The paper identifies that existing OCR tools, while effective for machine-printed text, struggle with handwritten, skewed, or rotated text in medical documents. The authors found that open-source OCR/HCR tools with modern deep learning architectures provided improved transcription performance[arXiv text].\n\n- Existing publicly available regexes are insufficient for capturing all date variations in medical texts. Manually constructed regexes improve recall substantially but at the cost of many false positives[arXiv text].\n\n- Regex synthesis from a comprehensive set of date strings generated by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps leads to regexes that achieve high precision with fewer false positives, though with a slight loss in recall compared to manual regexes[arXiv text].\n\n- Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the v3 LLaMA-8b, were tested for date-to-UNIX timestamp conversion but showed inconsistent accuracy, confirming that LLMs alone are inadequate for precise date extraction in this context[arXiv text].\n\n## Implications\n\n- The foundation of using UNIX timestamps as an unambiguous target format enables precise and explainable extraction of complex dates and date ranges, supporting high-stakes medical decision-making where explainability is critical.\n\n- Combining OCR/HCR transcription with deterministic regex-based extraction provides a transparent and auditable pipeline compared to opaque deep learning methods, aligning with regulatory demands for explainability in medical data processing.\n\n- Automated regex synthesis offers a sustainable, scalable alternative to manual rule creation, reducing human effort and improving maintainability when adapting to new date formats or languages.\n\n- The demonstrated limitations of LLMs and traditional computer vision for this task emphasize the need for hybrid approaches that leverage symbolic, explainable methods grounded in domain knowledge.\n\nOverall, this section establishes the necessary theoretical and technical background for the paper\u2019s contributions in extracting explainable date information from medical image-derived text by innovatively leveraging reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps and regex synthesis.", "citations": ["https://guides.library.yale.edu/dh/ocr", "https://www.hyperscience.com/knowledge-base/optical-character-recognition-ocr/", "https://guides.library.cornell.edu/text-as-data/ocr", "https://digitalorientalist.com/2023/09/26/train-your-own-ocr-htr-models-with-kraken-part-1/", "https://www.cogitotech.com/document-processing/ocr-transcription/"], "subsections": [{"id": "dates-unix", "title": "Dates and UNIX Timestamps", "content": "The \"Dates and UNIX Timestamps\" section in the paper provides a comprehensive overview of how dates are digitally represented using UNIX timestamps, discussing the historical background, technical limitations, and the necessity of supporting a broad temporal range. Below is a detailed analysis aligned with the paper's academic tone.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis and Summary of \"Dates and UNIX Timestamps\"\n\n**1. Key Points and Arguments**\n\n- **Definition and Standardization**: Dates are represented as UNIX timestamps, which count the number of seconds elapsed since the \"epoch\" starting at 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970. This standard is widely used for digital storage, transfer, and calculations involving date and time[2].\n\n- **Historical Context and Limitations**: The UNIX timestamp system originated when the UTC standard itself was only established in 1970. Notably, the original UNIX timestamp was defined using a signed 32-bit integer, which causes an \"integer overflow\" problem leading to the well-known Year 2038 problem. This limits the representable date range to approximately 69 years from the epoch, making it unsuitable for many applications requiring wider date coverage[2].\n\n- **Handling Negative Timestamps**: While the official standard did not initially include negative UNIX timestamps, representing dates before 1970, their use has become a common convention to indicate earlier dates[2].\n\n- **Extended Precision and Range**: To overcome the 2038 limitation, modern systems often employ 64-bit integers or floating-point values, considerably extending the range of representable dates beyond the original constraints[2].\n\n- **Importance of Wide Date Support**: Medical data and many other high-stakes domains often require date representations that span well beyond the 1970-2038 window. Supporting a broad range of dates is critical for accurate record-keeping, analysis, and decision-making.\n\n**2. Methods or Techniques Described**\n\n- The paper situates UNIX timestamps as a foundational representation, emphasizing the straightforward conversion between human-readable dates and integer-based timestamps for computational convenience.\n\n- While the paper does not delve into specific new methods for modifying UNIX timestamps themselves, it highlights the importance of using extended integer sizes to accommodate dates beyond the initial 32-bit limit.\n\n- The paper\u2019s broader research uses these UNIX timestamps as a target representation when reverse-engineering dates extracted from textual data in medical documents, but this section focuses on providing the baseline context about UNIX time representation.\n\n**3. Important Findings or Results**\n\n- The paper underscores that any practical system for date extraction and computation, especially in domains like medical informatics, must account for the limitations of the standard UNIX timestamp.\n\n- It confirms that the original UNIX timestamp standard is insufficient for long-term or retrospective data analysis due to its limited date range and that supporting negative timestamps is a necessary, though unofficial, extension.\n\n- It implies that using extended precision (64-bit or more) timestamps is standard in contemporary systems to ensure compatibility with a wide span of historical and future dates.\n\n**4. Implications**\n\n- The limitations of traditional UNIX timestamps highlight the necessity for any automated date recognition system to be prepared to handle dates outside the classical epoch window.\n\n- Systems relying on 32-bit UNIX timestamps may fail or produce incorrect results for medical data involving dates before 1970 or after 2038, which could have serious implications in medical decision support contexts.\n\n- The acceptance of negative timestamps and the move to wider integer formats reflect evolving practices in digital timekeeping, which must be integrated into robust AI-driven date extraction approaches.\n\n- This background also underscores the rationale for the paper\u2019s approach to reverse-engineering and synthesizing regular expressions that can capture a wide variety of date formats and ranges reliably and explainably, ensuring that the downstream UNIX timestamp conversion is both accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe section \"Dates and UNIX Timestamps\" explains that UNIX timestamps are a standardized integer representation of dates counting seconds since January 1, 1970, UTC. Although simple and widely supported, this representation originally suffered from a limited range due to 32-bit integer overflow, capping useful dates through 2038, and lacking official support for negative values representing dates before 1970. Contemporary systems often use 64-bit integers to overcome these limits. Supporting a wide range of dates beyond the original epoch boundaries is essential for fields like medical data processing, where accurate temporal representation influences high-stakes decisions. This context motivates the paper\u2019s focus on creating explainable, robust methods for extracting complex date information from text and converting these into precise UNIX timestamps for use in AI systems.\n\n---\n\nThis analysis aligns with the foundational background provided in the paper and external scholarly and practical resources about UNIX time representation.", "citations": ["https://www.unixtimestamp.com", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time", "https://www.epochconverter.com", "https://goteleport.com/resources/tools/unix-timestamp-converter/", "https://wraycastle.com/blogs/knowledge-base/unix-epoch-timestamp"]}, {"id": "ocr-hcr", "title": "Optical and Handwritten Character Recognition", "content": "The section titled **\"Optical and Handwritten Character Recognition\"** in the scientific paper provides a comprehensive overview of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and HCR (Handwritten Character Recognition) technologies, their use in document transcription, and the specific challenges involved in handling both printed and handwritten text, particularly in the context of medical documents.\n\n---\n\n## Key Points and Arguments\n\n- **OCR and HCR Technologies**: OCR is described as a mature and relatively solved problem for printed text recognition, capable of efficiently converting machine-printed documents into digital text. In contrast, HCR remains a significant challenge due to the vast variety in human handwriting styles, inconsistent characteristics such as typeface, weight, skew, and color, and the complexity involved in recognizing handwritten characters accurately[4].\n\n- **Applications**: Both OCR and HCR are primarily applied to transcribe documents into digital formats to facilitate automated data extraction, such as recognizing dates, names, and medical information in paper-based medical records. This transcription is crucial to reduce manual labor, costs, and error rates associated with human transcription[1][4].\n\n- **Challenges**: The section emphasizes that while printed text OCR can be performed with simpler software and algorithms, handwritten text recognition is still at the cutting edge of AI research. Challenges include noise in scanned images, text orientation, variations in handwriting, and the presence of superscript, skewed, or rotated text[4]. Moreover, the variability of handwritten text means traditional pattern-matching algorithms are insufficient, and deep learning methods are often required but may lack explainability[1][4].\n\n---\n\n## Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- **OCR Tools**: The paper mentions the use of open-source OCR tools such as Tesseract and EasyOCR. While these tools are effective for printed text, they struggle with handwritten or rotated, skewed text. More advanced tools like LLaVA-13b, MegaParse, and Azure's computer vision APIs have been experimented with, showing better performance for mixed and handwritten text[2].\n\n- **Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR)**: Since handwriting varies greatly, recognizing it involves sophisticated AI techniques, including neural networks and deep learning architectures designed to accommodate diverse handwriting styles and noise. These models, however, often lack transparency in their decision-making, which is critical in medical contexts[4].\n\n- **Preprocessing**: Images of documents are preprocessed by converting to grayscale, binarization (setting pixels above a threshold to white), and text pattern normalization to reduce complexity before applying recognition models. Specific preprocessing steps to handle handwritten noise and layout issues are also discussed[4].\n\n---\n\n## Important Findings or Results\n\n- **OCR vs. HCR Accuracy**: OCR tools achieve high accuracy on machine-printed documents, making OCR a \"solved\" problem in many respects. However, handwriting recognition continues to suffer from relatively high error rates, with nearly half of words sometimes incorrectly transcribed by state-of-the-art systems in tests[1].\n\n- **Limitations of AI Models**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision alone are insufficient for reliably recognizing complex date formats or handwritten text, due to variability and the infinite space of possible formats.

The key points, methods, findings, and implications are summarized below:\n\n## Key Points and Arguments\n\n- Explainability in AI is essential for ensuring transparency, trust, and accountability, especially in healthcare where decisions are impactful and closely scrutinized[1][2][3]. \n- Regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union\u2019s AI Act, mandate explainability for AI systems processing medical data to ensure they meet ethical and legal standards[1][3].\n- Explainability helps detect biases, improves decision quality, and supports clinician autonomy and doctor\u2013patient relationships by allowing AI rationale to be understood[1][2].\n- Traditional black-box AI models, particularly deep learning, often lack inherent explainability, which limits their adoption in clinical settings[1][3]. Explainability can be achieved either through inherently interpretable models or by providing understandable representations (e.g., rule-based logic, visual explanations)[1][3].\n- The paper advocates the use of deterministic predicate rules, specifically regular expressions (regexes), as an explainable form of AI logic for extracting dates from medical documents. These rules enable transparent and decomposable decision-making[1][3].\n\n## Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- The paper discusses explainability as achieved through deterministic logic rules of the form \u201cif [...] then [...]\u201d, with a focus on regular expressions to identify and parse date-like sequences in text data.\n- It highlights the benefits of regular expressions over black-box models for explainability, speed, and decomposability.\n- The novel approach involves creating regexes by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps from complex date and date-range representations in medical records. This method ensures that regexes capture a comprehensive and precise range of date formats while being explainable and consistent.\n- Regular expression synthesis is employed to automatically generate compact, generalizable, and explainable regexes from synthesized example data, avoiding the pitfalls of manual rule creation.\n\n## Important Findings or Results\n\n- Existing off-the-shelf regexes and advanced AI (e.g., computer vision, large language models) were inadequate for consistently and accurately extracting precise dates from complex medical document transcriptions[3].\n- Manually constructed bespoke regexes significantly improved recall and precision in date extraction but still produced many false positives due to overgeneralization.\n- Automatically synthesized regexes from reverse-engineered timestamps achieved a good balance between recall and precision, capturing the majority of true dates with fewer false positives than manual regexes. This shows the feasibility of learning deterministic and explainable date extraction logic from structured data representations.\n\n## Implications\n\n- Explainability is a foundational requirement for responsible AI use in medical settings, where decisions can affect patient outcomes and must be accountable to regulatory scrutiny[1][3].\n- The use of explainable, rule-based AI (regexes) in date extraction addresses shortcomings of black-box AI models by providing transparent, verifiable decisions that can be decomposed and audited.\n- The approach of reverse-engineering deterministic logic from structured data (UNIX timestamps) to create explainable regexes offers a novel, scalable method for building AI tools that comply with explainability requirements without sacrificing robustness.\n- This work supports the broader movement toward explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare, helping to bridge the gap between high-performing AI and clinical trust, facilitating adoption, and maintaining legal and ethical standards.\n\nIn summary, the \"Explainability\" section highlights the necessity of transparent AI in medical data processing, presents rule-based regular expressions as an effective explainable method for date extraction, and proposes an innovative synthesis approach that enhances explainability while maintaining high accuracy and consistency in complex clinical settings.", "citations": ["https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12025101/", "https://www.encora.com/insights/the-importance-of-explainable-ai-in-healthcare", "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9527344/", "https://medcitynews.com/2024/12/unlocking-ai-explainability-for-trustworthy-healthcare/", "https://www.greenlight.guru/blog/ai-explainability"]}, {"id": "regexes", "title": "Regular Expressions", "content": "The \"Regular Expressions\" section of the paper presents an in-depth discussion of regular expressions (regexes) as a deterministic and explainable tool for text pattern matching, particularly for extracting dates and date ranges from medical document transcriptions.\n\n**Key Points and Arguments:**\n\n- Regular expressions are framed as a deterministic method capable of precisely matching text patterns, making them inherently explainable compared to complex AI models like large language models or computer vision methods. This addresses important concerns regarding explainability in high-stakes domains such as medical data processing.\n- Despite their potential, off-the-shelf regexes are often insufficient for capturing the diverse formats of real-world dates, including multi-line date ranges and various linguistic forms (e.g., \u201cof\u201d, \u201cto the\u201d).\n- The authors argue that regexes can be decomposed and visualized, for example, via deterministic finite automata (DFAs), aiding understandability and manual analysis of the pattern-matching logic.\n- Manual creation of bespoke regexes tailored for the specific dataset of medical records improves date recognition recall significantly but at the cost of many false positives.\n- To overcome the limitations of manual regex engineering, the authors exploit *regular expression synthesis*, a process of automatically generating regexes from examples derived by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps. This approach generates more precise and decomposable regexes that generalize well over the full input space of dates.\n\n**Methods and Techniques Described:**\n\n- The section explains the construction of regexes using character literals and meta-characters (e.g., digit classes like `[0-9]`, quantifiers like `*`, and grouping via parentheses) to describe patterns matching date components.\n- Visualization and decomposition of regexes are illustrated with a DFA example capturing sequences of digit pairs separated by slashes, showing the transition states and the equivalence between automata and regex syntax.\n- The authors employ *regular expression synthesis* algorithms (specifically their implementation of Regex+) that create regexes from positive examples generated by enumerating all valid dates between two points in time (e.g., 1900\u20132100), reverse-engineering these from UNIX timestamps.\n- This synthesis uses a Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based cost function to balance specificity and simplicity of the resulting regex, ensuring that the final regexes are both compact and accurate.\n- The approach involves mapping each regex to a set of extraction rules to obtain specific date parts (day, month, year), handling date ranges, and accommodating variability in date formats (numeric, textual month names, ordinal suffixes).\n\n**Important Findings or Results:**\n\n- Pre-existing, highly accessible regex libraries achieved low recall (~28%) and precision (~36%) on the transcribed medical dataset, highlighting their inadequacy.\n- Manually crafted regexes improved recall to approximately 87.5% but generated many false positives, reducing precision.\n- Automatically synthesized regexes achieved better overall performance with a recall of around 42.9% and higher precision (about 83%) compared to manually made regexes, indicating fewer false positives while maintaining reasonable coverage.\n- The method produced regexes that are decomposable and robust to variations in date formats, including complex constructions such as day-month-year with separators, textual month abbreviations, ordinal day suffixes, and date ranges.\n\n**Implications:**\n\n- Regular expressions form a transparent, explainable, and deterministic alternative to opaque AI models for extracting critical information like dates from text in medical documents.\n- Visualization and decomposition of regexes support explainability and manual verification, essential in regulatory environments demanding accountable AI methods.\n- Regular expression synthesis automates and formalizes the creation of effective regex patterns, reducing the resource-intensive manual efforts typically required in knowledge engineering.\n- The approach generalizes well because it leverages the entire known input space derived from UNIX timestamps, minimizing the need for negative examples and enabling the generation of regexes that capture complex date ranges.\n- This work presents a novel integration of reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps and regex synthesis to reliably identify and extract explainable date information, which can be extended to other structured pattern recognition tasks in medical or other high-stakes textual data domains.\n\nIn summary, the \"Regular Expressions\" section establishes regexes as an explainable and robust method for medical date extraction, enhanced significantly by automated synthesis from comprehensive example sets, thereby addressing both accuracy and explainability challenges in this application area.", "citations": ["https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/relativity/relativity1217/reldbdsn/GUID-7C2DF185-41A1-4448-81E7-3252AA8DEBB3.html", "https://coderpad.io/blog/development/the-complete-guide-to-regular-expressions-regex/", "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions", "https://formulashq.com/pattern-matching-regular-expressions-regex-explained/"]}, {"id": "regex-synthesis", "title": "Regular Expression Synthesis", "content": "The \"Regular Expression Synthesis\" section of the paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of methods for automatically generating regular expressions (regexes) aimed at extracting dates from medical document transcriptions.

These emphasize balancing specificity and simplicity via cost functions (e.g., Minimum Description Length principle) to avoid overfitting[1][5].\n  \n- **Genetic Programming:** Evolutionary algorithms evolve regex candidates over generations to optimize regex quality. This can work well for large input spaces but may suffer from convergence difficulties and computational expense[1].\n  \n- **Neural Synthesis:** Neural network\u2013based methods accept examples or natural language descriptions as input to generate regexes.

The detailed analysis is as follows:\n\n1. **Key Points and Arguments Presented**\n\n- The authors initially experimented with computer vision methods to identify dates within images of medical records but found these methods inadequate due to the immense variability in date formats, visual styles, and the vast number of possible date variations. This complexity made it impractical to rely on computer vision alone for precise date extraction.\n\n- Subsequently, the authors explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the v3 LLaMA-8b from Meta, to convert natural language date expressions into UNIX timestamps. However, the LLMs showed inconsistent performance, often producing incorrect or varied UNIX timestamp outputs even when given explicit prompts.\n\n- These observations led to the conclusion that neither computer vision nor LLMs could reliably and consistently generate precise date representations (UNIX timestamps) from medical document images or text transcriptions.\n\n2. **Methods or Techniques Described**\n\n- For computer vision, the authors referenced prior work that successfully located handwritten date positions in images under very strict constraints (e.g., fixed color, style, position). However, this method did not yield the actual date components needed for timestamp conversion.\n\n- They conducted an empirical test with the v3 LLaMA-8b LLM by providing prompts asking for the UNIX timestamp of specific dates ranging from the 1st of January 1970 to the 31st of December 2030 in month/day/year format. The setup included configuring the model in a deterministic manner (seed and temperature set to 0) to assess consistent output generation.\n\n- The authors analyzed the LLM outputs by comparing the generated UNIX timestamps with the correct ones, measuring the absolute difference in days to evaluate the accuracy.\n\n3. **Important Findings or Results**\n\n- Computer vision approaches were found to be impractical due to the enormous diversity of date formats and visual representations, which would require an infeasibly large dataset to train models and still might not yield precise day, month, and year extraction.\n\n- The LLM\u2019s ability to generate exact UNIX timestamps was highly variable and unreliable. The LLM often demonstrated knowledge about UNIX timestamps conceptually but failed to translate this knowledge into consistently accurate numeric outputs.\n\n- The variability in LLM output indicates a bias related to the training data and suggests that LLMs may be unsuitable for tasks requiring precise, deterministic outputs like exact date-to-timestamp conversion.\n\n4. **Implications of the Information in This Section**\n\n- The limitations of computer vision and LLMs for date recognition justify the authors\u2019 focus on alternative, more explainable, and deterministic approaches such as manually constructed and synthesized regular expressions for date extraction.\n\n- This finding underscores the challenge of extracting structured, precise numerical data (e.g., dates as UNIX timestamps) from unstructured or semi-structured formats using contemporary AI models that excel at general pattern recognition but struggle with exact numeric conversions.\n\n- The failure of LLMs to generate consistent timestamps also highlights the importance of integrating deterministic logic or external computational tools when precise numerical transformations are required, especially in critical domains like medical data processing.\n\n- Overall, this analysis motivates the development of explainable, rule-based methods that can systematically parse date components and convert them into exact timestamps, enabling reliability and accountability in medical data extraction.\n\nIn summary, the \"Initial Attempts to Recognise Dates\" section establishes that both computer vision and LLM-based methods are currently inadequate for precise and consistent date recognition tasks in the medical domain, prompting the exploration of explainable, rule-based regular expression approaches.", "citations": ["https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-current-major-limitations-of-computer-vision", "https://tech4future.info/en/image-recognition-limitations/", "https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/limits-computer-vision-and-our-own", "https://www.atltranslate.com/ai/blog/top-8-problems-with-computer-vision-ai", "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9374580/"], "subsections": []}, {"id": "methodology", "title": "Methodology", "content": "The \"Methodology\" section of the paper on extracting explainable dates from medical images presents a comprehensive, multi-stage approach to accurately detect and parse dates from medical document transcriptions.

These alterations help reduce linguistic variability, especially in expressions of date ranges (e.g., transforming \"1st of June to the 5th of June\" into a simpler hyphenated form), making regular expression pattern matching more effective.\n\n**Important Findings or Results**\n\n- Although no direct quantitative results are presented specifically for preprocessing, the paper implies that these steps are foundational for subsequent processes like OCR transcription and regex-based date extraction.\n- The binarization thresholding and text substitutions are designed to reduce the anticipated number of regex patterns needed and likely contribute to improved precision and recall in date recognition later described.\n\n**Implications**\n\n- Effective preprocessing significantly impacts the accuracy and reliability of both AI-based transcription and rule-based date extraction methods.\n- Standardizing image inputs through greyscaling and binarization reduces noise and extraneous variability, which is crucial given the wide diversity in scanned medical documents (including variations in background noise and handwriting).\n- Text normalization supports the explainability and decomposability of subsequent logic-based extraction methods by simplifying date expressions and reducing ambiguities.\n- These preprocessing steps thus form a critical part of the pipeline enabling the authors\u2019 novel approach to reverse-engineer UNIX timestamps from complex date texts, enhancing both explainability and robustness.\n\nIn summary, the \"Data Preprocessing\" section details a carefully designed image and text preparation strategy that underpins the success of the paper\u2019s date extraction approach. By converting images to greyscale, applying binarization, and normalizing the text, the authors reduce noise and linguistic variability, enabling clearer, more explainable downstream extraction with regular expressions synthesized for complex medical date data.

Here is a detailed academic analysis and summary of the **Data Annotation** section from the referenced paper, following the requested structure.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Key Points and Arguments\n\nThe **Data Annotation** section outlines the meticulous process of date extraction and labelling from medical documents using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). The section emphasizes:\n\n- **Manual Annotation Process**: Dates within the documents were manually identified and labelled by vetted personnel using CVAT, ensuring high data integrity and compliance with security standards like ISO 27001[3][5].\n- **Data Cleaning**: Incomplete date annotations (those missing month or year parts) were removed to maintain dataset quality and consistency.\n- **Automatic Timestamp Calculation**: Start and end UNIX timestamps were automatically derived from the annotated date parts, facilitating precise digital reasoning about temporal data.\n\nThis approach is justified as it enables the extraction of complex, explainable date ranges from medical records, which is challenging for purely automated methods due to formatting variability and the need for explainability in high-stakes healthcare settings[2][5].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Methods and Techniques\n\nThe section details the following techniques:\n\n- **Manual Annotation with CVAT**: Skilled annotators labelled dates in medical documents using CVAT, a leading open-source tool for image and video annotation. CVAT supports interactive manual annotation, attribute assignment, and flexible data tagging, which is crucial for accurate medical data annotation[1][3][5].\n- **Data Curation**: Annotations lacking essential components (month or year) were discarded to avoid ambiguous or incomplete data points.\n- **UNIX Timestamp Generation**: Annotated date parts were algorithmically converted to UNIX timestamps, standardizing date representation across the dataset for subsequent analysis and model training[5].\n\nThese methods ensure both human oversight and technical rigor, balancing explainability with automation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Important Findings or Results\n\n- **Data Quality and Preprocessing**: The manual annotation process resulted in a high-quality, curated dataset. Removal of incomplete annotations increased the reliability of subsequent analyses.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The use of CVAT and automated timestamp calculation made the annotation process both efficient and scalable, accommodating large volumes of medical data[1][2].\n- **Compliance and Security**: Strict adherence to security standards (ISO 27001) during data handling ensured the protection of sensitive medical information throughout the annotation process[5].\n\nThese findings collectively support the paper\u2019s broader argument that explainable, deterministic methods (like manual annotation and regular expression synthesis) are necessary for accurate date extraction in medical records.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Implications\n\n- **Explainability in AI**: The manual annotation approach provides a transparent, auditable process, which is critical for compliance with regulatory requirements and ethical AI deployment in healthcare[2][5].\n- **Model Robustness**: High-quality, manually curated datasets improve the robustness and accuracy of downstream AI models, particularly when dealing with complex or ambiguous data formats.\n- **Industry Best Practices**: The described workflow (manual annotation with CVAT, data cleaning, and automated timestamping) can serve as a reference for other projects involving sensitive or explainable medical data annotation[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                       | Details                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annotation Tool              | CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)                                                  |\n| Annotation Process           | Manual by vetted annotators, onsite, with ISO 27001 compliance                          |\n| Data Cleaning                | Removal of incomplete date annotations                                                   |\n| Timestamp Calculation        | Automated from annotated date parts                                                      |\n| Key Benefits                 | Explainability, data quality, regulatory compliance, scalability                        |\n| Implications                 | Supports ethical AI, model robustness, industry best practices                          |\n\n---\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the Data Annotation section delineates a rigorous, explainable, and scalable workflow for extracting and standardizing date information from medical documents, leveraging both human expertise and automated tools to achieve reliable, regulatory-compliant results[1][2][5].", "citations": ["https://www.cvat.ai", "https://www.cvat.ai/resources/blog/medical-data-annotation", "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat", "https://www.cvat.ai/blog/best-open-source-image-annotation-tools-2024", "https://tinkogroup.com/computer-vision-annotation-tool/"]}, {"id": "transcription", "title": "Document Transcription", "content": "The \"Document Transcription\" section of the paper presents a thorough examination of various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) tools for transcribing medical documents, focusing on extracting date-related information accurately and explainably. The key points, methods, findings, and implications are summarized below:\n\n## 1. Key Points and Arguments\n\n- The section argues that existing OCR tools like EasyOCR and Tesseract, while popular and effective in some contexts (especially Tesseract for scanned print documents and EasyOCR for scene text), have limitations in recognizing complex or handwritten text, particularly when text is superscripted, rotated, skewed, or handwritten[1][2].\n\n- Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaVA-13b, although powerful at understanding images and textual content, are not sufficiently reliable for producing precise UNIX timestamps from date transcriptions due to variability in output formats and inconsistency across date inputs[4].\n\n- The research posits that a combination of OCR/HCR transcription followed by carefully designed regular expressions provides a more reliable and explainable approach for extracting complex dates and date ranges from medical documents.\n\n## 2. Methods and Techniques Described\n\n- The paper evaluated multiple OCR and HCR tools for document transcription:\n\n  - **EasyOCR** and **Tesseract** were initially tested but found insufficient for reliably recognizing complex or handwritten date text.\n\n  - Tools like **pdfium** and **poppler** were tried but struggled with handwritten or image-nested text recognition.\n\n  - The open-source **LLaVA-13b** OCR and HCR model was ultimately employed for better recognition performance when prompted simply with \u201cwhat text is in this image?\u201d[4].\n\n  - Azure\u2019s computer vision tools combined with the MegaParse library also showed strong transcription results.\n\n- Transcribed text was then processed with different types of regular expressions (regexes):\n\n  - Four widely accessible, standard regexes were first applied to the transcriptions, showing inadequate recall and precision in detecting dates.\n\n  - Bespoke regexes were manually constructed to better capture complex date formats and date ranges, improving detection performance but increasing false positives.\n\n  - Finally, regular expression synthesis was used to automatically generate regexes by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps into text examples covering the entire date range of interest. The Regex+ synthesis algorithm was used to produce regexes balancing specificity and simplicity.\n\n## 3. Important Findings or Results\n\n- **OCR/HCR Tool Limitations:** Both EasyOCR and Tesseract have known constraints in processing non-standard text, such as handwritten or skewed content, with EasyOCR slightly outperforming Tesseract generally but neither adequate for the full complexity encountered[1][2].\n\n- **LLaVA-13b Performance:** This large multimodal model could recognize a majority of text in medical images, outperforming conventional OCR tools in handling handwritten and complex layouts, but LLMs overall were unreliable for direct UNIX timestamp extraction due to inconsistent formatting and variability in responses[4].\n\n- **Regex Detection Performance:**\n\n  - Highly accessible regexes resulted in low recall (~28%) and precision (~36%) for date detection.\n\n  - Manually crafted bespoke regexes significantly improved recall to 87.5% but with many false positives, indicating over-detection.\n\n  - Regexes synthesized via reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps achieved a balanced performance with recall around 42.9% and precision near 83%, capturing complex dates more robustly with fewer false positives than manual regexes.\n\n## 4. Implications\n\n- The findings suggest that while off-the-shelf OCR and LLM tools offer some capability in transcribing medical documents, they fall short in reliably and explainably extracting structured temporal information such as dates.\n\n- Combining advanced OCR/HCR transcription (like LLaVA-13b) with synthetically generated, explainable regexes enables more accurate and interpretable date extraction. This is critical in medical contexts where the provenance and explainability of extracted data impact high-stakes decisions.\n\n- Automatic regex synthesis guided by reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps provides a scalable and maintainable method to generate precise, explainable rules tailored to all valid date formats within specific ranges, avoiding the resource-intensive, brittle manual engineering of patterns.\n\n- This approach can potentially be generalized to other types of structured data extraction from complex documents, supporting the broader goal of explainable AI in sensitive domains.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the \"Document Transcription\" section details a methodological investigation into OCR and HCR tool efficacy, culminating in a novel strategy of combining transcription with regular expression synthesis to reliably and explainably identify dates and date ranges from medical image documents.

Key Points and Arguments Presented\n\nThe \"Highly-Accessible Regexes\" section addresses the evaluation of four publicly available, easy-to-access regular expressions (regexes) designed for date detection in medical document transcriptions. The authors argue that these existing, widely-used regexes have significant limitations in both precision and recall when applied to real-world data. This section serves as a benchmark, demonstrating the inadequacy of these regexes for capturing complex date formats and ranges commonly present in medical records.\n\nKey arguments include:\n- Existing regexes fail to capture the majority of dates accurately.\n- The widespread regexes were originally created for general or simplistic date formats and are not sufficient for medical data with diverse and complex date representations.\n- Applying these regexes in medical contexts results in many missed detections (low recall) and many false positives (low precision).\n\n### 2. Methods or Techniques Described\n\nThe authors:\n- Selected four publicly accessible regex patterns, each designed to detect dates in different common formats. These include:\n  - A pattern detecting a number, a full Gregorian month name, and a four-digit year separated by spaces.\n  - A pattern matching numeric day/month/year sequences separated by slashes.\n  - A pattern to detect day/month/year numbers separated by characters from the set [ -/].\n  - A regex generated by the v3 LLaMA-8b language model prompted to create a date-detecting regex in day-month-year format.\n  \n- Applied these four regexes to transcriptions of 884 pages of medical documents containing 1280 manually annotated dates.\n- Measured the results using confusion matrices and computed precision and recall metrics to quantify performance.\n\n### 3. Important Findings or Results\n\nFrom the experiments, the section reveals:\n\n- The combined recall of these four highly-accessible regexes was only **28.14%**, meaning more than 70% of actual dates were not detected.\n- The precision was also low at **35.7%**, indicating that many non-date text sequences were falsely identified as dates.\n- The confusion matrix (Fig. 3 in the paper) starkly illustrates the high number of false negatives and false positives.\n- These results confirm that publicly available regexes are insufficient for complex and diverse date formats found in medical documents.\n- The regex generated by the LLM, despite being tailored to the task, did not perform adequately, reflecting limitations in automated regex generation from natural language prompts.\n\n### 4. Implications of the Information in this Section\n\nThis section establishes the critical limitation of readily available regex solutions in medical text date extraction. The implications are:\n\n- **Necessity of Specialized Regexes:** Generic regexes are inadequate for complex date extraction needs, particularly in sensitive and high-stakes domains such as medical records. This necessitates the design of bespoke or synthesized regexes tailored to domain-specific data characteristics.\n  \n- **Limitations of Automated Regex Generation from LLMs:** While LLMs can generate regex patterns from prompts, their output may lack the precision and generalization needed for production tasks in specialized domains, highlighting the need for human-in-the-loop or advanced synthesis methods.\n\n- **Requirement for Improved Methods:** The poor performance encourages exploration of other approaches, such as manual construction of regexes informed by domain knowledge or automated regex synthesis from complete data sets (described in subsequent sections).\n\n- **Impact on Medical Data Processing:** Given the poor detection rates of publicly available regexes, reliance on these tools could lead to incomplete or erroneous data extraction, affecting downstream medical decisions and analysis reliant on accurate date information.\n\n---\n\n### References to Contextual Paper Content\n\n- The paper\u2019s Abstract and Introduction highlight that complex date extraction from medical images/transcriptions is a challenging problem not adequately solved by current AI or regex tools.\n- Section IV.E specifically reports the experiment with these four accessible regexes, while subsections F and G describe bespoke regex creation and regex synthesis as improvements.\n- The detailed explanation of regex limitations complements the broader argument that explainability and precision in date extraction are essential for medical AI applications (Section II.C on Explainability).\n- The analysis of regex performance is coupled with a careful definition of evaluation metrics (precision and recall defined in Section II.F).\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe \"Highly-Accessible Regexes\" section demonstrates that commonly available regular expressions for date detection perform poorly on medical document transcriptions, with low recall and precision. This critical finding motivates the need for more sophisticated, domain-specific regex solutions and sets the stage for the paper's subsequent proposals on manual regex construction and regex synthesis from exhaustive date datasets.

For each timestamp, the corresponding day, month, and year components were extracted to create multiple date string permutations reflecting real-world variations (e.g., numeric dates, abbreviated month names, ordinal day suffixes).\n- **Regex Synthesis:** These generated date strings were provided as positive examples to the Regex+ synthesis tool. Regex+ constructs all possible regexes capturing these examples within a graph and selects the minimal cost regex.\n- **Date Formats Covered:** Synthesized regexes covered formats such as:\n  - Numeric day/month/year with varied separators (-, ., /),\n  - Three or more letter month abbreviations plus year,\n  - Full date phrases including ordinal day suffixes and prepositions (e.g., \"1st of April, 2020\").\n- **Date Ranges:** The synthesis also generated patterns for date ranges expressed through hyphens between day parts; however, month-range synthesis was limited to avoid combinatorial explosion.\n\n## Important Findings and Results\n\n- Applying synthesized regexes to real transcribed medical documents improved precision markedly (82.96%) compared to bespoke manually created regexes (87.5%) and highly accessible regexes (35.7%).\n- Recall was slightly lower (42.86%) than bespoke regexes (30.35%) but substantially better than accessible regexes (28.14%).\n- Synthesized regexes reduced false positives, meaning fewer incorrect matches of non-date text sequences falsely identified as dates.\n- The approach is robust and adaptable, automatically generating regexes that comprehensively cover the input space of relevant dates without manual intervention or programming-language dependencies.\n\n## Implications\n\n- This method offers a scalable, maintainable alternative to manual regex engineering for extracting explainable, precise date information from noisy and complex medical document transcriptions.\n- By grounding regex creation on reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps, the approach ensures correctness and completeness in pattern coverage.\n- The balance of simplicity and specificity achieved by Regex+ synthesis makes the resulting regexes more interpretable and less prone to error, advancing explainable AI in high-stakes medical contexts.\n- Automating regex generation mitigates common challenges of brittleness and labor intensity in rule-based date extraction systems, facilitating deployment across diverse document types and formats.\n- To the authors' knowledge, this is a novel application of learning deterministic logic through reverse-engineering many-to-one mappings (timestamps to date strings) combined with regex synthesis.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, the \"Regex Synthesis\" section details a rigorous, automated strategy to construct compact, accurate, and explainable regexes for date extraction by leveraging reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps and the Regex+ synthesis algorithm, demonstrating improved precision and maintainability over manual methods in medical text transcription scenarios[1].", "citations": ["https://chatpaper.com/chatpaper/paper/137177", "https://news.mit.edu/2024/scribbleprompt-helping-doctors-annotate-medical-scans-0909", "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10189241/", "https://github.com/shawnyuen/DeepLearningInMedicalImagingAndMedicalImageAnalysis", "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9892348/"]}]}, {"id": "results-evaluation", "title": "Results / Evaluation", "content": "The \"Results / Evaluation\" section presents a comparative performance analysis of three approaches to date extraction from medical document transcriptions: public (highly-accessible) regular expressions, bespoke (manually-crafted) regular expressions, and synthesized regular expressions generated through automatic regex synthesis.\n\n**Key Points and Arguments:**\n\n- The section evaluates precision and recall metrics to measure the effectiveness of each regex approach in recognizing dates and date ranges accurately within the transcribed medical documents.\n- Publicly-available regexes demonstrated limited capability, failing to capture many real dates, leading to low recall and moderate precision.\n- Manually-created bespoke regexes achieved high recall (detecting most true dates) and high precision but generated a large number of false positives\u2014detecting many sequences that resembled dates but were not actual dates.\n- Synthesized regexes, derived by reverse-engineering UNIX timestamps and employing an automatic regex synthesis algorithm (Regex+), struck a balance between the two previous approaches by reducing false positives significantly but slightly increasing the number of missed true dates (lower recall than bespoke regexes).\n\n**Methods and Techniques:**\n\n- Public regexes included four commonly accessible patterns tested against OCR- and HCR-derived transcriptions.\n- Bespoke regexes were manually developed by analyzing 81 pages to create \"optimal\" detection patterns covering various date formats, including numeric, textual months, ordinal day indicators, and multi-line and range date formats.\n- The regex synthesis approach generated all possible date strings from UNIX timestamps spanning 1900 to 2100 and used these as positive examples for the Regex+ synthesis algorithm.

The process uses a Minimum Description Length (MDL) cost function to balance specificity and simplicity.\n- **Example Generation:** Synthetic date strings were generated from all possible dates between 1900 and 2100, including various separators, ordinal markers, and month name variations.\n- **Precision and Recall Metrics:** These are used to quantify the effectiveness of each approach, with a focus on minimizing both false positives and false negatives.\n\n---\n\n## **Important Findings and Results**\n\n- **Public Regexes:** Achieved low recall (28.14%) and precision (35.7%), demonstrating their inadequacy for the task.\n- **Bespoke Regexes:** High recall (87.5%) but low precision (30.35%), capturing most real dates but also many false positives.\n- **Regex Synthesis:** Achieved a balance with recall of 42.86% and precision of 82.96%, showing that synthetically generated regexes can reduce false positives while maintaining reasonable recall.\n\n---\n\n## **Implications**\n\n- **Explainability:** Regular expressions, particularly those generated through synthesis, provide transparent and explainable logic for date extraction, which is crucial for compliance and auditing in medical and regulatory contexts.\n- **Maintainability:** Automated synthesis reduces the manual effort required to update or expand date extraction logic, making systems more adaptable to changing requirements.\n- **Generalizability:** The approach is language-agnostic and can handle diverse date formats, making it suitable for international and legacy medical records.\n- **Ethical AI:** The discussion emphasizes the importance of explainable AI in high-stakes applications, where accountability and transparency are mandated by regulations such as the EU AI Act.\n\n---\n\n**In summary**, the \"Discussion\" section highlights the limitations of traditional and manual regex solutions, advocates for automated regex synthesis as a robust and explainable alternative, and outlines key future challenges for improving date extraction from medical documents. The results suggest that regex synthesis offers a promising path forward for complex and high-stakes data extraction tasks, balancing accuracy, explainability, and maintainability.", "citations": ["https://cs.usm.maine.edu/~behrooz.mansouri/courses/Slides_NLP_23/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20--%20Session%203%20-%20Regular%20Expressions.pdf", "https://youngwei.com/pdf/SemRegex-AAAI.pdf", "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=83e2851bb3843ef8f7dfb9f882c8e0fdf5613751", "https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/2.pdf", "https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00339/96479/Sketch-Driven-Regular-Expression-Generation-from"], "subsections": []}, {"id": "conclusion", "title": "Conclusion", "content": "The \"Conclusion\" section of the paper titled \"Extracting Explainable Dates From Medical Images By Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps\" presents a concise synthesis of the key findings and recommendations based on the preceding research. The analysis of this section can be structured as follows:\n\n## Key Points and Arguments Presented\n\n- The section reinforces the effectiveness of using explainable, regex-based methods for date extraction from medical documents. This approach provides a transparent and deterministic alternative to black-box AI models, which is critical in high-stakes medical contexts.\n- It emphasizes the need for further investigation into regular expression synthesis techniques with the goals of reducing false positives, enhancing the automation process, and integrating deeper contextual understanding of date information in texts.\n- The conclusion implicitly highlights that while manually constructed regexes perform well, automated synthesis of regexes can improve robustness and maintainability in real-world applications.\n\n## Methods or Techniques Described\n\n- The core technique discussed is the use of regular expressions (regex) to extract dates from transcribed medical documents. The paper explores different regex approaches:\n  - Manually crafted regex rules targeting complex date formats.\n  - Automatic regex synthesis from reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps to generate regexes that comprehensively cover all possible date expressions within a given range.\n- This approach contrasts with other AI-driven methods such as computer vision or large language models, which were found insufficient for precise date extraction in this domain.\n- Reverse engineering UNIX timestamps serves as a novel data-driven method to generate robust training examples for regex synthesis, ensuring coverage and reducing the need for negative examples.\n\n## Important Findings or Results\n\n- Manually created regexes were effective at capturing a majority of real dates but generated a significant number of false positives.\n- Regex synthesis, through the use of the Regex+ algorithm, generated regexes that achieved a better balance: maintaining high precision with fewer false positives, though at a minor cost to recall.\n- This demonstrates that regex synthesis can create explainable and decomposable regexes that reliably identify complex dates and date ranges in medical text.\n- The results indicate that regex-based methods outperform large language models and traditional computer vision approaches in terms of explainability and accuracy for this task.\n\n## Implications of the Information in this Section\n\n- The findings validate regex-based extraction as a viable and explainable approach to handling sensitive and high-stakes medical data, aligning with regulatory and ethical requirements for explainability.\n- Regex synthesis offers a scalable, maintainable alternative to manual regex creation, potentially enabling more automated, robust extraction pipelines that adapt efficiently to new or evolving formats.\n- Incorporating contextual knowledge and further reducing false positives through advanced regex synthesis could significantly improve the reliability of automated data extraction in healthcare, impacting medical decision-making and data management.\n- The approach contributes a novel methodology for learning deterministic logic from complex real-world mappings, advancing the field of explainable AI in natural language processing for medical applications.\n\nIn summary, the conclusion highlights the promise of explainable regex methods synthesized from reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps for robust date extraction from medical documents. It encourages continued research to refine these techniques, focusing on automation, precision, and contextual integration to improve practical deployment in healthcare environments.", "citations": ["https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/extract-medical-named-entities-with-regex-in-healthcare-nlp-at-scale/", "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2656039/", "https://healtharkinsights.com/keyword-extraction-using-regex-tf-idf-and-bert-a-comprehensive-approach/", "https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/21/5/850/760478", "https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/thesis/t.pdf"], "subsections": []}, {"id": "acknowledgements", "title": "Acknowledgements", "content": "The \"Acknowledgements\" section of the paper titled *\"Extracting Explainable Dates From Medical Images By Reverse-Engineering UNIX Timestamps\"* briefly expresses gratitude to colleagues and funding bodies that supported the research.
