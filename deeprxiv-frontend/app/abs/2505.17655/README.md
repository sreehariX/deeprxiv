## Abstract
Given a pair of source and reference speech recordings, audio-to-audio (A2A) style transfer involves the generation of an output speech that mimics the style characteristics of the reference while preserving the content and speaker attributes of the source. This paper proposes a novel framework, termed as A2A Zero-shot Emotion Style Transfer (A2A-ZEST), that enables the transfer of reference emotional attributes to the source while retaining its speaker and speech contents. The A2A-ZEST framework consists of an analysis-synthesis pipeline, where the analysis module decomposes speech into semantic tokens, speaker representations, and emotion embeddings. Using these representations, a pitch contour estimator and a duration predictor are learned. Further, a synthesis module is designed to generate speech based on the input representations and the derived factors. This entire paradigm of analysis-synthesis is trained purely in a self-supervised manner with an auto-encoding loss.

Abstract â€”Given a pair of source and reference speech record-
ings, audio-to-audio (A2A) style transfer involves the generation
of an output speech that mimics the style characteristics of the
reference while preserving the content and speaker attributes
of the source. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
termed as A2A Zero-shot Emotion Style Transfer (A2A-ZEST),
that enables the transfer of reference emotional attributes to
the source while retaining its speaker and speech contents. The
A2A-ZEST framework consists of an analysis-synthesis pipeline,

these representations, a pitch contour estimator and a...
