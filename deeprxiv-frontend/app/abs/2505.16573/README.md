## Abstract
Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting, traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends, which could improve predictive performance. We propose a novel method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data, facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy.

Abstract â€”Stock price prediction is a critical area of finan-
cial forecasting, traditionally approached by training models
using the historical price data of individual stocks. While these
models effectively capture single-stock patterns, they fail to
leverage potential correlations among stock trends, which could
improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning
methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader
understanding of price dynamics across multiple stocks. To
address this, we propose a novel method that merges local
patterns into a global understanding through cross-stock pattern
integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning
(FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training.
